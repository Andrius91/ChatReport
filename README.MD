# ChatReport

This repository contains a plugin developed in Java 8 designed to work in the BungeeCord environment, a proxy platform that allows the connection and administration of servers in Minecraft. The plugin focuses on the implementation of a robust reporting system that is connected via a REST API.

The built-in reporting system provides players with an easy and efficient way to report problems, issues, or inappropriate behavior on the Minecraft server. Players can generate detailed reports and submit them directly through an intuitive in-game interface.

The connection with the REST API allows a fluid and secure communication between the BungeeCord server and other external systems or applications. This provides the possibility of monitoring and advanced analysis of the reports received, as well as integration with incident management and monitoring tools.
